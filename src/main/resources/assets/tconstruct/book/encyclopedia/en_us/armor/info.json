    { "text": "Armor is crafted in the Crafting Station instead of the Tinker Station or Anvil. All pieces start with 1 ability slot, but have a varying number of upgrade and defense slots. Unlike tools, holding the armor typically provides no effect; most modifiers require wearing the armor to be applicable." }
